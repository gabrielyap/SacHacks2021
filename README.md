# SacHacks2021
# I made this project during Sacramento's 2021 Hackathon in order to teach myself Statistics based Python libraries(pandas, numpy) 
# It is a statistical research on how time can affect the development of a fictional game. The python libraries are used to create models from the dataset and analyze trends.
