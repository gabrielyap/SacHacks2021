# SacHacks2021
# I made this project during Sacramento's 2021 Hackathon in order to teach myself pandas and numpy in Python. 
# I've been really interested in learning how Statistics and Programming can synergize together in order to answer questions, so I found an interesting dataset off kaggle.com
# and researched it.
